```bash
# Set admin custom claims via Firebase Admin SDK
# Add this to your admin script:
```

```javascript
// scripts/setup-admin.js
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.applicationDefault()
});

async function makeUserAdmin(email) {
  try {
    const user = await admin.auth().getUserByEmail(email);
    await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(user.uid, { admin: true });
    console.log(`Admin privileges granted to ${email}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error making user admin:', error);
  }
}

// Replace with your admin email
makeUserAdmin('your-admin-email@domain.com');
```

## üåê Vercel Deployment

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Or via CLI:
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID
# ... add all environment variables
```

### Option B: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```bash

```javascript
// Test via admin dashboard or API
const testResearchEntry = {
  editorId: "test-editor-123",
  type: "biography",
  title: "Test Research Entry",
  content: "Test content for research functionality",
  confidence: "medium",
  sources: [{
    type: "website",
    url: "https://example.com",
    reliability: "medium"
  }]
};

// POST to /api/research/test-editor-123
// Expected: Entry created successfully, appears in UI
```

#### Knowledge Graph Test
```bash
# Test knowledge retrieval
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/knowledge/test-editor-123"

# Expected: Structured knowledge summary
# Verify: Data aggregation working correctly
```

#### Research Panel UI Test
- [ ] Navigate to editor detail page
- [ ] Open research panel  
- [ ] Add new research entry
- [ ] Verify entry appears immediately
- [ ] Test edit/delete functionality
- [ ] Check confidence scoring display

### 3. Data Synchronization Tests

#### Manual Sync Test
```bash
# Trigger data sync
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Expected: Sync process initiated
# Verify: Logs created, data updated
```

#### Algolia Index Sync Test
```bash
# Test Algolia synchronization
npm run sync:algolia

# Expected: All editors indexed in Algolia
# Verify: Search returns updated data
```

### 4. Authentication & Authorization Tests

#### Admin Access Test
- [ ] Login as admin user
- [ ] Access admin dashboard (/admin)  
- [ ] Create/edit/delete editor entries

### 5. Performance & Security Tests

#### Performance Test
```bash
# Test search response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" "https://your-domain.com/api/editors?q=Emmy"

# Expected: Response time < 200ms for Algolia
# Create curl-format.txt with timing info
```

#### Security Test
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl "https://your-domain.com/api/editors" &
done

# Expected: Some requests blocked/throttled
```
